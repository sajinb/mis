I don't have the repository name — the URL you gave is just the GitHub account (https://github.com/sajinb). Please tell me which repository under that account I should scan (the exact repo name). 

Also confirm:
- I should only read files under src/main/java/com/hr/mis (yes/no).
- Output should follow the JSON array format you specified (one object per endpoint, with id, javaEntityClass, tableName, entityFields).
- I should only consider classes annotated with @RestController or @Controller and methods annotated with @PostMapping, @PutMapping, or @PatchMapping.

Once you provide the repository name (and confirm the above), I'll scan only src/main/java/com/hr/mis for the controllers and extract the endpoint→entity metadata.
