I don’t have the repository name — the URL you gave is just the GitHub user page (https://github.com/sajinb). Which repository under that account should I scan? Please provide the repository name (or a full repository URL). Once you provide that I’ll read only the Java files under src/main/java/com/hr/mis, discover the POST/PUT/PATCH endpoints, trace into services/repositories, and return the requested JSON metadata.
